# Challenge Summary
Review the provided pseudocode then trace the algorithm by stepping through the process with the provided sample array. Document your explanation by creating a blog article that shows the step-by-step output after each iteration through some sort of visual.

Once you are done with your article, code a working, tested implementation of Merge Sort based on the pseudocode provided.

## Whiteboard Process
<!-- Embedded whiteboard image -->

## Approach & Efficiency
* Space complexity Big O(n)
* Time complexity Big O(nLogn)


## Solution
Take a list and sort it in place.
```
before: int_list = [8,4,23,42,16,15]
$ merge_sort(int_list)
after: int_list == [4,8,15,16,23,42]
```
